# LevelNine - Spring Boot Learning Journey

## 🎯 About This Project

This project represents my **Level Nine** journey in Spring Boot development, inspired by the LOTM (Lord of the Mysteries) series progression system.

**Level Nine = Beginner/Foundation Level**

I'm documenting my learning path from basics to advanced Spring Boot concepts, with each level representing increased mastery.

## 📚 What I'm Building

A **Production-Grade Blog Application** solving real-world problems:

### Core Features:
- **User Management** - Registration, Login, CRUD with BCrypt encryption
- **Article Management** - Full CRUD with pagination and authorization
- **Nested Comment System** - Reddit/YouTube-style threaded discussions (see below)
- **Like/Unlike Features** - Social engagement for articles
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based auth

### 🌟 Featured: Nested Comment System

**Real-world implementation** of threaded comments like Reddit, YouTube, and Quora:

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Unlimited Nesting** with depth limit (max 5 levels)
- ✅ **Lazy Loading** - Load replies on demand for performance
- ✅ **Soft Delete** - Preserves conversation threads
- ✅ **Authorization** - Users can only edit/delete their own comments
- ✅ **Pagination** - Handles thousands of comments efficiently
- ✅ **Security** - Cross-article reply prevention

**Technical Highlights:**
- Self-referencing JPA relationships (`@ManyToOne` to itself)
- Recursive DTO structures for nested responses
- Depth validation and calculation algorithms
- Guard clauses for clean validation logic
- Repository query methods with Spring Data JPA

**Example Structure:**
```
Article: "Spring Boot Tutorial"
  ├─ Comment 1: "Great article!" (depth 0)
  │   ├─ Reply: "I agree!" (depth 1)
  │   │   └─ Reply: "Me too!" (depth 2)
  │   └─ Reply: "Thanks!" (depth 1)
  └─ Comment 2: "Very helpful" (depth 0)
      └─ Reply: "Agreed!" (depth 1)
```
